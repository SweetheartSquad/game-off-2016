        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Print a gameset.</li>
            <li>Cut the gameset into individual pieces.</li>
            <li>Shuffle character cards and have each player choose one randomly. Look at your own, but keep these secret from other players until the end of the game.</li>
            <li>Shuffle the file cards and place the deck facedown by the board.</li>
            <li>Shuffle the program cards and place the deck facedown by the board.</li>
            <li>Place an avatar token for each player on the "start" positions on the board.</li>
            <li>Decide who goes first.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cards</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Characters have a set of 1-3 implants/traits which affect their final score.</li>
            <li>Files have a point value (0-3) and one of three filetypes. Once drawn, a file remains face-up for the rest of the game.</li>
            <li>Abilities have text which explains what they do.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Playing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player gets 2 actions per turn.
            <li>
                Actions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Move your avatar 1 space</li>
                    <li>Draw an program card facedown</li>
                    <li>Use an program card
                    <li>If on the server, draw a file faceup</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once a player has used both of their actions, the next player starts their turn.</li>
            <li>When program cards are used, place them in a separate pile. Once every program card has been drawn, re-shuffle this pile and use it as the new program deck.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Over</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As soon as the last file is drawn, the game is over. Each player reveals their character card, and points are tallied. You may not use any remaining abilities.
            <li>A player's points are calculated as the sum of all the files they hold, plus any bonuses/modifiers from their character card.
            <li>
                <h3>Ties</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If two or more players are tied for first place, continue the game by drawing/playing abilities until the tie is broken.
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Misc.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can move forwards or backwards. For example: if a player uses the program "target player moves up to 2 spaces", they could A) target themselves and move forwards, or B) target another player and move them backwards.</li>
            <li>You can choose to do the same action twice on your turn. For example, you could draw two program cards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Gameset Details</h1>
        <p>A full gameset is fitted to a single letter-sized piece of paper, which needs to be cut into individual pieces.</p>
        <img src="example-gameset.png" alt="example gameset" title="example gameset" width="319" height="413"/>
        <p>When finished cutting, you should have:
            <ul>
                <li>4 character cards</li>
                <li>20 file cards</li>
                <li>30 program cards</li>
                <li>1 game board</li>
                <li>4 avatar tokens</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The avatar tokens on the corners of the game board are simple papercrafts, and can be assembled like so:</p>
        <img src="avatar-instructions.png" alt="instructions on how to assemble avatar tokens" title="instructions on how to assemble avatar tokens" width="500" height="200"/>
        <p>If you prefer, you can cut out and use the center squares alone to save some setup time.</p>
        <p>An example of an entire assembled gameset can be seen below:</p>
