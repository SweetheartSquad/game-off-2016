    </section>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Finish the game with the highest number of File points</p>

        <h2>Pieces</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Character have a set of 1-3 traits which affect score</li>
            <li>Files have a point value (0-3) and one of three types. Once drawn, a File remains face-up forever</li>
            <li>Programs have text which explains what they do</li>
            <li>The Gameboard has a Server (board center) and four paths leading to the Server</li>
            <li>The Avatar tokens are cubes used to represent player position on the Gameboard</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Shuffle Characters and distribute; look at your own, but keep these secret from other players until the end of the game</li>
            <li>Shuffle Files and place deck facedown</li>
            <li>Shuffle Programs and place deck facedown</li>
            <li>Place an avatar token for each player on the "start" positions on the Gameboard</li>
            <li>Decide who goes first</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Playing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player gets 2 actions per turn
                <ul>
                    <li>Move your Avatar 1 space</li>
                    <li>Draw a Program card facedown</li>
                    <li>Use a Program card</li>
                    <li>If on the Server, draw a File faceup</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When Programs are used, place them in a separate pile; once every Program has been drawn, shuffle and re-use this pile as a new Program deck</li>
            <li>The game ends when the last File is drawn: reveal Characters and tally points (you MAY NOT use any remaining Programs)</li>
            <li>Points are calculated as the sum of all Files held, plus any extra from Characters</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Misc.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If players tie for first place, continue the game drawing/playing Programs until the tie is broken</li>
            <li>You can move forward or backward (e.g. if a player uses the Program "target player moves up to 2 spaces" they could move themself forwar OR move someone else backward)</li>
            <li>You can use same action twice on a turn (e.g. you could draw two Program cards)</li>
            <li>If multiple players need to draw cards at the same time (e.g. the Program "everyone draw 3 cards") start with the player who used the Program and continue in turn order</li>
        </ul>
